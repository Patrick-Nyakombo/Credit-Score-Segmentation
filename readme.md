## Credit Scoring and Segmentation
Credit scoring and segmentation involve assessing the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and categorizing them into specific groups based on their credit characteristics. This process is designed to evaluate the probability of borrowers meeting their debt obligations, aiding financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding lending practices and credit risk management. In this repo, I will implement credit scoring and segmentation using Python.

### Overview
The process of determining credit scores and categorizing customers accordingly involves several key stages. First, essential information about borrowers, such as payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, and the variety of credit types is gathered and organized. This data is then analyzed through the use of sophisticated algorithms and statistical models, producing a credit score for each borrower.
These credit scores serve as numerical indicators of a borrower’s creditworthiness, reflecting the probability of default or timely repayment. Once the scores are calculated, customers are classified into various risk categories or credit tiers based on established thresholds.
This classification enables financial institutions to evaluate the credit risk associated with each customer and make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, interest rates, and credit limits. By segmenting customers, institutions are better equipped to manage their lending portfolios and mitigate the risk of defaults.

### Description of the Data

    - Gender: This feature captures the gender of the individual.
    - Marital Status: This feature denotes the marital status of the individual.
    - Education Level: This feature represents the highest level of education attained by the individual.
    - Employment Status: This feature indicates the current employment status of the individual.
    - Credit Utilization Ratio: This feature reflects the ratio of credit used by the individual compared to their total available credit limit.
    - Payment History: It represents the monthly net payment behaviour of each customer, taking into account factors such as on-time payments, late payments, missed payments, and defaults.
    - Number of Credit Accounts: It represents the count of active credit accounts the person holds.
    - Loan Amount: It indicates the monetary value of the loan.

    - Type of Loan: It includes categories like “Personal Loan,” “Auto Loan,” or potentially other types of loans.

### Summary

Credit scoring and segmentation involve assessing the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and categorizing them into distinct groups based on their credit profiles. This process evaluates the likelihood of borrowers repaying their debts, aiding financial institutions in making well-informed decisions regarding lending practices and managing credit risk effectively.
